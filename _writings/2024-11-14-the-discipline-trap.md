I've noticed something.

When I needed discipline to do something, it meant I was fighting myself.

The work I do best requires no discipline. I forget to eat. Hours disappear. There's no forcing.

What you call discipline is actually resistance management. You're pushing against something inside that doesn't want to move.

The question isn't "how do I build more discipline?"

It's "why does this require force?"

When you're aligned with what you actually want - not what you think you should want - discipline becomes irrelevant.

The effort you're describing is the cost of self-conflict.
