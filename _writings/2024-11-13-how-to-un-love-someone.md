You don't.

I've watched this in myself. Love isn't something you carry - it's something you build each time you think of them.

Where is it when you're not thinking of them? Asleep? Absorbed in something else?

It only exists when your attention feeds it.

I stopped asking how to un-love. Started watching what happens when I don't feed the thought.

The pattern dissolved on its own.

Not through force. Through seeing what I was actually doing.
